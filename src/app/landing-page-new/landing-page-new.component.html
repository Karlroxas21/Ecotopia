          Eco-Friendly Waste Disposal Practices: A Key Strategy for Climate
          Change Mitigation
        </h1>
        <p>
          Proper waste disposal is crucial for mitigating climate change as it
          reduces the release of harmful greenhouse gases into the environment.
          As an example, not shredding paper and compressing bottles before
          disposal can make recycling and waste management more efficient,
          decreasing the carbon footprint associated with waste processing and
          helping to combat climate change.
