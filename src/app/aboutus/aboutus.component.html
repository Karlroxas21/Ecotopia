                    <h5>Team Lead / Full Stack Developer</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      I'm a fourth-year college student at National University - Manila,
                      currently pursuing a degree in BSIT-MAA. Although my course is
                      specializing into graphics, I'm determined to become a developer.
                      I love learning about different technologies, and I can
                      confidently say that I can handle pretty much anything if given
                      enough time. Math, networking, algorithms, hardware and philosophy
                      also interest me, so I spend a lot of time reading and watching
                      computer-related stuff. I believe in forming good habits every
                      day, so that when opportunities comes my way, I'm ready to seize
                      them. As Epictetus said, "If you want to be beautiful, you have to
                      make beautiful choices."

                      I'm a fourth-year college student at National University - Manila,
                      currently pursuing a degree in BSIT-MAA. I am a Front-End
                      developer with a passion for creating user-friendly and responsive
                      websites. I have learned various web technologies and frameworks
                      through my projects in college, where I designed and developed a
                      website for a local business. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS,
                      JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Angular to create modern and dynamic
                      web pages that meet the needs and expectations of the clients and
                      users.

                    <p>
                      I'm a fourth-year student at National University of Manila pursuing
                      BSIT-MAA. I aspire to be a designer and an artist. I'm currently
                      developing my artistic style through improving my performing arts
                      abilities, and yet I currently appreciate drawing line arts and
                      designing layouts for my personal web portfolio. I firmly believe
                      in the phrase "malayo PA, pero malayo NA," which refers that I'm
                      still far from my dreams, but I'm far enough to be grateful. This
                      is despite the fact that I may have discovered my skills somewhat
                      later in life, I'm still excited to make the leap and refine my
                      skill with the people I'm working with.

                    <p>
                      I am a fourth-year IT student at National University and a
                      freelance character artist. I spent most of my years learning to
                      draw, and I am admittedly still a learner. I have experience in
                      cartooning, character illustration, character design and
                      watercolor painting. I create fan-art for games, popular anime
                      shows and series and create original characters outside of
                      fan-content. I aim to expand my experience to background
                      illustration, comics and graphic design.
