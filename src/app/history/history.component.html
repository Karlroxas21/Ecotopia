        <h1>History of climate change science</h1>
        <p>
          The history of the scientific discovery of climate change began in the
          early 19th century when ice ages and other natural changes in
          paleoclimate were first suspected and the natural greenhouse effect
          was first identified. In the late 19th century, scientists first
          argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change Earth's
          energy balance and climate. Many other theories of climate change were
          advanced, involving forces from volcanism to solar variation. In the
          1960s, the evidence for the warming effect of carbon dioxide gas
          became increasingly convincing. Some scientists also pointed out that
          human activities that generated atmospheric aerosols (e.g.,
          "pollution") could have cooling effects as well.<br><br>During the 1970s,
          scientific opinion increasingly favored the warming viewpoint. By the
          1990s, as the result of improving the fidelity of computer models and
          observational work confirming the Milankovitch theory of the ice ages,
          a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply involved in
          most climate changes and human-caused emissions were bringing
          discernible global warming. Since the 1990s, scientific research on
          climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded.
          Research has expanded our understanding of causal relations, links
          with historic data, and abilities to measure and model climate change.
          Research during this period has been summarized in the Assessment
          Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.<br><br> Climate
          change, broadly interpreted, is a significant and lasting change in
          the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging
          from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average
          weather conditions or in the distribution of weather around the
          average conditions (such as more or fewer extreme weather events).
          Climate change is caused by factors that include oceanic processes
          (such as oceanic circulation), biotic processes (e.g., plants),
          variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics and
          volcanic eruptions, and human-induced alterations of the natural
          world. This last effect is currently causing global warming, and
          "climate change" is often used to describe human-specific impacts.
