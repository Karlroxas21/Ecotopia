          Climate change is a complex global problem with scientific, economic,
          societal, political, and moral dimensions, and it will persist for
          thousands of years. Despite halting greenhouse gas emissions, the
          long-lasting presence of carbon dioxide and the delayed response of
          the planet mean that future generations will still experience the
          effects of global warming and climate change. Humanity is therefore
          bound to a certain level of climate change.

          There are two approaches to address climate change: mitigation and
          adaptation.

            <b style="font-size: 23px; color: #2082c8">1. Mitigation</b>
            <br />
            involves reducing and stabilizing the presence of greenhouse gases
            in the atmosphere to limit further warming.Â 
          <br />
          <br>
            <b style="font-size: 23px; color: #2082c8">2. Adaptation</b>
            <br />
            focuses on adjusting to the changes that are already occurring due
            to climate change.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Mitigation</b> refers to the actions taken to reduce climate change
          by decreasing the release of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the
          atmosphere. This can be achieved by limiting the sources of these
          gases, such as the combustion of fossil fuels for energy and
          transportation, or by enhancing natural sinks like forests, oceans,
          and soil that absorb and store these gases. The objective of
          mitigation is to prevent significant human interference with the
          Earth's climate, stabilize greenhouse gas levels within a timeframe
          that allows ecosystems to naturally adapt to climate change, safeguard
          food production, and support sustainable economic development (as
          outlined in the 2014 report on Mitigation of Climate Change by the
          United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, page 4).
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Adaptation</b> refers to the process of adapting to the challenges posed
          by a changing climate, both present and anticipated. The objective is
          to minimize the risks associated with the adverse impacts of climate
          change, such as rising sea levels, intensified extreme weather events,
          and food scarcity. Additionally, adaptation involves harnessing any
          potential advantages that may arise from climate change, such as
          longer growing seasons or improved agricultural yields in certain
          regions. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout history, societies have dealt with climate changes
          and extremes to varying degrees of success, with climate-related
          factors contributing to the rise and fall of civilizations,
          particularly through droughts. The stability of Earth's climate over
          the past 10,000 years has allowed for the development of modern
          civilization and agriculture, which are adapted to this stable climate
          rather than the warmer conditions anticipated in the future. As our
          climate continues to change, adaptation becomes crucial, and the speed
          at which it changes affects the level of difficulty. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Although climate
          change is a global challenge, its impacts are experienced at the local
          level, making local governments the forefront of adaptation efforts.
          Cities and communities worldwide have been addressing their specific
          climate issues by constructing flood defenses, preparing for heatwaves
          and higher temperatures, implementing improved drainage systems to
          handle floods and stormwater, and enhancing water storage and
          management. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Governments at various levels are increasingly integrating
          adaptation measures into their development plans, as highlighted in
          the 2014 report on Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation, and
          Vulnerability by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
          Change (page 8). These efforts involve managing extreme disasters,
          protecting coastlines from sea-level rise, implementing sustainable
          land and forest management practices, preparing for and mitigating
          droughts, developing resilient crop varieties, and safeguarding energy
          and public infrastructure.
