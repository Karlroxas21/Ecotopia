          Using the Understanding Global Change icons, we can visualize the web
          of cause and effect relationships in the Earth system that result in
          global change. Below is a model explaining some of the cause and
          effect relationships relevant to sea level rise. An important cause of
          sea level rise is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases
          greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and through the greenhouse
          effect increases average global air temperatures. In turn, the higher
          air temperatures increase the melting rate of glaciers and ice caps
          (decreasing snow & ice cover), and the melted water contributes to sea
          level rise. The arrows show how these processes and phenomena are
          connected. We also included an icon to capture one of the consequences
          of sea level rise, the displace human populations around the world. As
          you build your own models, you can challenge yourself and your
          students to think of additional connections not represented in this or
          other models on the website

          The world is now warming faster than at any point in human history.
          The effects are extreme weather like heavy rain or droughts, long-term
          shifts in weather patterns, melting ice and rising sea levels. Climate
          change is already having huge impacts on people and the environment
          worldwide. Human activities that release greenhouse gases need to be
          urgently curbed as much as possible to ensure a stable climate and
          safe world for everyone.

            <b style="color: #E89B12; font-size: 27px;">Generating power</b>
            <br />
            Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a
            large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still generated
            by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and
            nitrous oxide – powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and
            trap the sun’s heat. Globally, a bit more than a quarter of
            electricity comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources
            which, as opposed to fossil fuels, emit little to no greenhouse
            gases or pollutants into the air.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b style="color: #E89B12; font-size: 27px;">Manufacturing goods</b>
            <br />
            Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning
            fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron,
            steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. Mining and
            other industrial processes also release gases, as does the
            construction industry. Machines used in the manufacturing process
            often run on coal, oil, or gas; and some materials, like plastics,
            are made from chemicals sourced from fossil fuels. The manufacturing
            industry is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas
            emissions worldwide.

            <b style="color: #E89B12; font-size: 27px;">Cutting down forests</b>
            <br />
            Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other
            reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release
            the carbon they have been storing. Each year approximately 12
            million hectares of forest are destroyed. Since forests absorb
            carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep
            emissions out of the atmosphere. Deforestation, together with
            agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible for roughly a
            quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b style="color: #E89B12; font-size: 27px;">Using transportation</b>
            <br />
            Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes
            transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially
            carbon-dioxide emissions. Road vehicles account for the largest
            part, due to the combustion of petroleum-based products, like
            gasoline, in internal combustion engines. But emissions from ships
            and planes continue to grow. Transport accounts for nearly one
            quarter of global energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions. And
            trends point to a significant increase in energy use for transport
            over the coming years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b style="color: #E89B12; font-size: 27px;">Producing food</b>
            <br />
            Producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and
            other greenhouse gases in various ways, including through
            deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture and grazing,
            digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers
            and manure for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm
            equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels. All this
            makes food production a major contributor to climate change. And
            greenhouse gas emissions also come from packaging and distributing
            food.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b style="color: #E89B12; font-size: 27px;">Powering buildings</b>
            <br />
            Globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of
            all electricity. As they continue to draw on coal, oil, and natural
            gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of
            greenhouse gas emissions. Growing energy demand for heating and
            cooling, with rising air-conditioner ownership, as well as increased
            electricity consumption for lighting, appliances, and connected
            devices, has contributed to a rise in energy-related carbon-dioxide
            emissions from buildings in recent years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b style="color: #E89B12; font-size: 27px;">Consuming too much</b>
            <br />
            Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat and
            how much you throw away all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
            So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, electronics, and
            plastics. A large chunk of global greenhouse gas emissions are
            linked to private households. Our lifestyles have a profound impact
            on our planet. The wealthiest bear the greatest responsibility: the
            richest 1 per cent of the global population combined account for
            more greenhouse gas emissions than the poorest 50 per cent.
